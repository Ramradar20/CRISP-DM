Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.
The code should run with no issues using Python 3.

Project Motivation

For this project, I was interested in using AirBnB Seattle data from 2016 to 2017 to understand:

1.	What are the top three locations with the most AirBnB listings?
2.	Does the listing price change over the season or month?  If so, when is the most economical time to visit Seattle? 
3.	How does the other factors such as # of bedrooms or review scores impact the listing price?

The full set of files related to this project is owned by AirBnB and available on Kaggle.

File Descriptions

There is one notebook here - Seattle_AirBnB_W_Ye - to showcase work related to the above questions.  Markdown cells 
were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available at:
